# Aaron's Config files and ubuntu CTF vm setup repository

run setup.sh to set up a clean ubuntu vm with my ctf tools and environment.

Remember to add the fonts to font manager and set your preferences in Terminal accordingly!

This repository also contains my custom ghidra tool for use with ghidra in ghetto "dark mode."

It also contains my wallpapers, mostly JoJo stuff.
